# AI-Assisted Development Documentation

This project was developed using AI tools strategically to speed up development, debugging, and documentation while maintaining full authorship and understanding of the final code.

## Tools Used

### **GitHub Copilot**
- Generated boilerplate code
- Suggested completions for repetitive patterns
- Helped format functions and CLI structure

### **ChatGPT**
Used extensively for:
- Debugging import errors and module issues
- Fixing Windows / OneDrive environment conflicts
- Writing README.md, LICENSE, CI workflow, and test files
- Explaining API integration patterns
- Generating pytest test cases

---

## Example Prompts Used

### Planning Phase
> “Help me design a weather CLI app in Python with multiple commands.”

### Debugging Phase
> “Why is my module import failing? Here is my folder structure and error.”

### Testing
> “Generate pytest tests for utils.py and API functions.”

### Documentation
> “Write a professional README with badges.”

## Reflection

AI greatly improved the speed and quality of development.  
However:
- All AI-generated code was reviewed and edited
- Several suggestions required debugging or simplification
- Final logic and implementation decisions were made manually

AI served as an assistant, not an autonomous developer.
